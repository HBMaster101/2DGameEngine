 BRIEF
=======
Welcome to the terrehbyte-math-library, a math library (obviously) that has been written to do math things.
This library was written with me in mind as a user and for others as a learning tool to exemplify what to do
and what not to do.

Supported data types include Vector2, Vector3, Vector4, Matrix3x3, and Matrix4x4. See documentation for usage
and purpose of each function.

For documentation, see the wiki for usage examples (eventually) and descriptive one-liners of each member function.
